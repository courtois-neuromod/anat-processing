## qMRLab Docker images 

With each [qMRLab release](https://github.com/qMRLab/qMRLab/releases), the `minimal` docker image is built automatically. Available 
tags can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/qmrlab/minimal/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated).

## Docker images for external (non-qMRLab) processes

If available, off-the-shelf containers can be used by modifying `nextflow.config` file.

`Dockerfiles` of other Docker images maintained by qMRLab (e.g. `qmrlab/antsfls`) are available in 
this directory.
